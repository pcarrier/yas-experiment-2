//! Vulkan-based GPU compositor renderer.
//!
//! Replaces the EGL/GLES2 renderer for compositing Wayland client surfaces
//! into a single output image.  Uses `ash` with the `loaded` feature to
//! dlopen libvulkan.so at runtime.
//!
//! Key advantages over the GL path:
//! - Explicit pixel format control (`VK_FORMAT_B8G8R8A8_UNORM`)
//! - Top-down framebuffer (no Y-flip needed)
//! - DMA-BUF import/export with explicit modifiers
//! - Proper synchronization via Vulkan fences
