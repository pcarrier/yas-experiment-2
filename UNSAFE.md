# Unsafe code in YAS

Unsafe code is confined to three crates (`server`, `browser`, `compositor`) that need direct POSIX/Win32 terminal/process APIs, foreign function declarations, or graphics APIs. The remaining crates contain zero `unsafe` blocks.

This document focuses on the non-obvious parts — the invariants that are easy to break.

## The `waitpid` race

The server has two independent call sites for `waitpid`:

1. **Per-PTY cleanup** (`cleanup_pty`) — sends `SIGHUP`, closes the master fd, then calls `waitpid(child_pid, WNOHANG)` for the specific child.
2. **Background zombie reaper** — calls `waitpid(-1, WNOHANG)` every 5 seconds to sweep any zombies.

These intentionally race. The reaper can collect a child before `cleanup_pty` gets to it — that's fine because `cleanup_pty` uses `WNOHANG` and tolerates `ECHILD`. Neither call site blocks. If you change either to use blocking `waitpid`, you'll deadlock.

## The fork/exec sequence

`spawn_pty` in [`crates/server/src/pty/pty_unix.rs`](crates/server/src/pty/pty_unix.rs) runs a specific post-fork sequence in the child that must not be reordered:

```
child: close(master) -> setsid() -> ioctl(TIOCSCTTY) -> dup2(slave, 0/1/2)
     -> close(slave) [if slave > 2] -> close_fds_except(3) -> signal(SIGPIPE, SIG_DFL)
     -> set_qos_user_interactive() [macOS] -> chdir() -> execve(envp)
```

`setsid` must come before `TIOCSCTTY` (can't set a controlling terminal without being a session leader). `dup2` must come before closing the slave fd (otherwise stdio points at nothing). The `close(slave)` is conditional on `slave > 2` — if slave happens to be fd 0/1/2, the `dup2` calls already aliased it. `close(master)` happens first in the child because the child must not hold the master fd — if it did, reads from master in the parent would never see EOF when the child exits.

`close_fds_except(3)` closes all inherited parent fds (IPC listener, other PTY masters, epoll fd, compositor fds) to prevent the child from accessing other terminals. `signal(SIGPIPE, SIG_DFL)` resets SIGPIPE handling since the Rust runtime sets it to SIG_IGN, which breaks piped commands.

The child's environment is built before `fork()` via `build_child_env()` and passed to `execve()` — this avoids calling `std::env::set_var`/`remove_var` after fork in a multi-threaded process (not async-signal-safe per POSIX). PATH resolution is also done before fork via `resolve_in_path()`.

On the parent side, `close(slave)` is equally important — the parent must not hold the slave fd, or the master won't get a hangup when the child exits.

## PTY exit draining

The Unix reader uses `poll` before `read` so it can observe an exit-drain
request while a descendant holds the slave open. `FIONREAD` writes into a live
`c_int` and establishes a finite remaining byte count. Reads are bounded by
both that count and the allocated buffer. The reader is the sole consumer of
the master fd. Ordinary exit cleanup must wait for its ordered EOF before
closing the fd; emptying the Rust channel alone does not prove the reader or
kernel buffer is empty.

## Compositor child spawn

`spawn_compositor_child` in [`crates/server/src/lib.rs`](crates/server/src/lib.rs) is a simpler fork/exec path used to launch Wayland GUI commands (e.g. `foot`). The child calls `chdir()`, mutates the environment (`set_var`/`remove_var` for `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, `DISPLAY`), then `execvp`. Unlike the PTY spawn path, it does not call `setsid`, `TIOCSCTTY`, or `close_fds_except` — the child inherits the parent's fd table. This is acceptable because compositor children don't need a controlling terminal and don't interact with PTYs.

## Windows ConPTY in `server`

[`crates/server/src/pty/pty_windows.rs`](crates/server/src/pty/pty_windows.rs) implements PTY support on Windows via the ConPTY API. The unsafe surface covers:

- **`CreatePseudoConsole`/`ClosePseudoConsole`** — creating and destroying the pseudo console. The console handle is stored in `PtyHandle` and must outlive all pipe I/O.
- **`CreateProcessW`** — launching the child process attached to the ConPTY via `PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_PSEUDOCONSOLE`. The attribute list is initialized with `InitializeProcThreadAttributeList` + `UpdateProcThreadAttribute`.
- **`CancelSynchronousIo` / `PeekNamedPipe`** — the supervisor cancels a blocked reader after the exit grace, using the live thread handle owned by its `JoinHandle`. It retries to cover cancellation racing the start of `ReadFile`. The reader then captures the available byte count, bounds subsequent reads by that count and buffer capacity, and sends ordered EOF after forwarding the remainder. The output pipe has exactly one reader.
- **`ReadFile`/`WriteFile`** — blocking reads from the output pipe (in a dedicated reader thread) and writes to the input pipe. The pipe handles come from `CreatePipe` and must be closed in the correct order — the parent's end of the input pipe is closed by `ClosePseudoConsole`, and the child's inherited ends are closed immediately after `CreateProcessW`.
- **`unsafe impl Send + Sync`** for `PtyHandle`, `PtyWriteTarget`, and `SendHandle` — these wrap raw Windows `HANDLE` values that are safe to use from any thread once created.

## fd-passing via `recvmsg`

The server uses `SCM_RIGHTS` ancillary data to receive client connection fds over a Unix socket (from systemd socket activation or the Edge service). The `recv_fd` function calls `recvmsg` with a manually constructed `msghdr` and `cmsghdr`, then extracts the fd from the control message.

The received fd is immediately wrapped in `from_raw_fd` to transfer ownership to Rust. If the `from_raw_fd` call were skipped or the fd were used after being wrapped, you'd get a double-close.

## Environment variable mutation in the child

`std::env::set_var` and `std::env::remove_var` are `unsafe` as of Rust edition 2024 because they mutate global process state and are not thread-safe. The PTY spawn path builds the child environment before `fork()` via `build_child_env()` and passes it to `execve()`, avoiding post-fork `set_var`/`remove_var`.

The compositor child path (`spawn_compositor_child` in `crates/server/src/lib.rs`) still calls `set_var`/`remove_var` after fork to set `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, and remove `DISPLAY`. This is tolerated because the child calls `execvp` immediately after, replacing the process image, and no other thread exists in the child after `fork()`.

## macOS-specific FFI

Two macOS-only calls that aren't in the `libc` crate:

- **`proc_pidinfo(PROC_PIDVNODEPATHINFO)`** — gets the child process's working directory by reinterpreting a raw byte buffer as `proc_vnodepathinfo`. The pointer cast is sound only if the buffer is large enough and the syscall succeeds (checked via return value).
- **`pthread_set_qos_class_self_np(QOS_CLASS_USER_INTERACTIVE)`** — declared as a local `unsafe extern "C"` function. Bumps thread priority so the frame scheduler gets lower latency. Harmless if it fails.

## WASM FFI in `browser`

`crates/browser/src/lib.rs` declares an `unsafe extern "C"` block for JavaScript helper functions injected via `#[wasm_bindgen(inline_js)]`. The functions (`yasFillTextCodePoint`, `yasFillTextStretched`, `yasFillText`, `yasMeasureMaxOverhang`) are called from safe Rust through wasm-bindgen's generated bindings. The `unsafe` marker is required by edition 2024 for all `extern` blocks.

## Dmabuf and SHM pixel reads in `compositor`

`read_dmabuf_buffer` in [`crates/compositor/src/imp.rs`](crates/compositor/src/imp.rs) uses `libc::readlink` on `/proc/self/fd/{fd}` to resolve the DMA-BUF fd path for diagnostics, and returns the fd/fourcc/modifier metadata as `PixelData::DmaBuf` for zero-copy import by the GPU renderer or CPU fallback.

The SHM path in `commit()` uses `std::slice::from_raw_parts` to read from the client's shared memory pool. The safety contract: the slice is only used within the commit handler and does not outlive the buffer mapping.

`spawn_compositor` calls `std::env::set_var("XDG_RUNTIME_DIR", …)` inside an `unsafe` block when the variable is unset (e.g. macOS). This is called once at the start of the compositor thread before any Wayland socket is created. The invariant: no other thread reads `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` concurrently at that point; the variable is only consumed by `ListeningSocketSource::new_auto` immediately after.

The calloop event loop calls `unsafe { display.get_mut() }` to obtain a mutable reference to the Wayland `Display` for `dispatch_clients` and `flush_clients`. This is sound because the `Generic` source callback has exclusive access to the fd at that point — no other calloop callback touches the display concurrently.

## GPU encoder dlopen in `server`

`crates/server/src/gpu_libs.rs` loads GPU driver libraries at runtime via `dlopen`/`dlsym` with fallback names (VA-API: `libva.so.2`/`libva.so`, `libva-drm.so.2`/`libva-drm.so`; NVENC: `libcuda.so.1`/`libcuda.so`, `libnvidia-encode.so.1`/`libnvidia-encode.so`). Function pointers are resolved once via `OnceLock` and stored in static `Send + Sync` structs. The `DynLib` wrapper calls `dlclose` in its `Drop` impl. The invariants: every `dlsym` result is null-checked before transmuting to a typed function pointer; the `DynLib` handle must outlive all resolved pointers (enforced by storing `_lib: DynLib` in each `*Fns` struct); and the function signatures must exactly match the C driver ABI.

## NVENC direct encoder in `server`

`crates/server/src/nvenc_encode.rs` drives NVIDIA's NVENC hardware encoder through the function pointer table returned by `NvEncodeAPICreateInstance`. All NVENC structs are opaque byte arrays sized to match `nv-codec-headers` 12.1.14.0 — fields are written at verified offsets rather than through `#[repr(C)]` struct translation, because the SDK structs contain large reserved arrays and padding that change between API versions.

The `NvEncFunctionList` struct must match the SDK's `NV_ENCODE_API_FUNCTION_LIST` layout exactly — each function pointer slot corresponds to a specific API entry point. A 64-slot `_future` padding array absorbs new entries added by newer SDK versions. The struct version tags embed the API version (12.1) and a type version via `NVENCAPI_STRUCT_VERSION(v) = NVENCAPI_VERSION | (v << 16) | (0x7 << 28)` — some structs additionally set bit 31. Getting any of these wrong produces `NV_ENC_ERR_INVALID_VERSION` (error 15).

NVENC sessions share a retained CUDA primary context. Each worker pushes that context before GPU operations and pops it afterwards; dropping a session must not destroy the shared context. Input registrations describe the current dimensions and pitch, whether they import compositor allocations or reference a lazily allocated CUDA upload buffer.

Resolution changes use `nvEncReconfigureEncoder` with exclusive session ownership on a blocking worker, after the previous encode has unmapped its input and unlocked its output. Sessions reserve at most 25% growth per axis, capped by hardware limits; shrinking below one quarter of that reserved area rebuilds to release memory. A successful resize unregisters and releases the old input resources before another encode can allocate or import replacements; it also clears cached H.264 headers and forces an IDR. Dimensions beyond the reservation, split-frame mode changes, or driver refusals take the normal rebuild path. Codec, chroma, preset, and maximum dimensions remain fixed within a session.

## VA-API direct encoder in `server`

`crates/server/src/vaapi_encode.rs` implements H.264 encoding via VA-API's C interface loaded through `gpu_libs.rs`. `VaapiDirectEncoder` accesses all VA-API parameter buffer structs (SPS, PPS, slice) as raw byte arrays at verified offsets rather than `#[repr(C)]` struct translation, since the VA-API headers contain complex bitfields.

Surface pixel upload uses `vaDeriveImage` + `vaMapBuffer` to get a raw pointer into driver-owned memory. Writes into this mapping use the image-reported `pitches` (not packed width). The mapping must be unmapped (`vaUnmapBuffer`) and the derived image destroyed (`vaDestroyImage`) before the surface is submitted for encoding. Violating this ordering corrupts the driver's internal state.

Encoded bitstream readback walks a linked list of `VACodedBufferSegment` structs via raw pointer arithmetic at hardcoded offsets (`CBS_BUF_OFF`, `CBS_NEXT_OFF`), reading each segment's data pointer and size to copy out the NAL units.

## DMA-BUF CPU fallback in `server`

`crates/server/src/surface_encoder.rs` reads DMA-BUF pixel data via `mmap` + `DMA_BUF_IOCTL_SYNC` when no zero-copy GPU import path is available. The `mmap` size is determined by `lseek(SEEK_END)` on the fd. The sync start/end brackets ensure cache coherence with the GPU. The mapped slice must not outlive the `munmap` call.

## GPU compositing in `compositor`

`crates/compositor/src/vulkan_render.rs` loads Vulkan at runtime via the `ash` crate's `loaded` feature (dlopen `libvulkan.so`). `VulkanRenderer` manages a Vulkan instance, device, queue, command pool, descriptor pool, and pipeline for compositing Wayland client surfaces. DMA-BUF textures are imported via `VK_EXT_external_memory_dma_buf` and `VK_EXT_image_drm_format_modifier`. SHM buffers are uploaded via `HOST_VISIBLE` linear images. `unsafe impl Send for VulkanRenderer` is required because Vulkan handles are raw pointers accessed only from the compositor thread.

Surface textures are persistent: created at `wl_surface.commit` time and cached in `surface_textures` keyed by Wayland `ObjectId`. When a surface commits a new buffer, the old texture is moved to `pending_destroy_textures` and freed after the current GPU submission completes (fence signal). This avoids per-frame texture re-creation and ensures the GPU never accesses freed memory.

Output images are double-buffered and allocated with `DEVICE_LOCAL` preference (falling back to `HOST_VISIBLE`). When Vulkan Video encode extensions are available, the compositor encodes directly on the GPU after the BGRA→chroma compute shader: render → compute → video encode → bitstream readback, returning `PixelData::Encoded`. The encode source is a compositor-owned device-local image created with `VIDEO_ENCODE_SRC_KHR` usage and a `VkVideoProfileListInfoKHR` matching the session, so this path does not depend on VA-API having exported anything; its format follows the session's chroma (`G8_B8R8_2PLANE_420_UNORM` or `G8_B8R8_2PLANE_444_UNORM`), as does the shader that fills it. Because that image is read from the video-encode queue while the compute that fills it runs on the graphics queue, the encode waits on the render submission's fence before reading. Parameter sets are fetched once with `vkGetEncodedVideoSessionParametersKHR` and prepended to each IDR — Vulkan Video emits slice NALs only, so a stream without them is undecodable. When VA-API external output buffers are available, the renderer composites into GBM LINEAR BGRA DMA-BUFs and a compute shader writes NV12 into VA-API-exported multi-plane VkImages (tiled or linear), returning `PixelData::Nv12DmaBuf` for server-side encoding. Otherwise it falls back to self-allocated output images with `HOST_VISIBLE` staging buffers for CPU readback via `PixelData::Bgra`. The staging pointer (`staging_ptr`) is valid for one full frame cycle (double-buffered output images guarantee the buffer isn't reused until the next frame is retired). External outputs and NV12 compute buffers are per-surface (`HashMap<u32, Vec<...>>`).

The invariants: Vulkan objects must be destroyed in the correct order — images and image views before the device, descriptor sets before the pool, command buffers before the command pool, and the device before the instance (`Drop` impl handles ordering); imported DMA-BUF memory must not be accessed after the client destroys the underlying buffer (`held_buffers` in the compositor prevents early `wl_buffer.release` while the GPU texture references the fd); staging buffer mappings must be consumed by the encoder before the output image is reused for the next render; and evicted persistent textures are deferred to `pending_destroy_textures` until the in-flight GPU submission completes.

## `PR_SET_PDEATHSIG` on long-lived service children

`AudioPipeline::shutdown` and `DesktopBus::drop` kill their child processes and wait for them. But when the YAS server is killed via SIGKILL (for example, during a forced supervisor restart after a rebuild), Rust destructors don't run and the children become orphans reparented to PID 1.

To prevent this, every long-lived service `Command::new()…spawn()` in [`crates/server/src/audio.rs`](crates/server/src/audio.rs) and [`crates/server/src/desktop_bus.rs`](crates/server/src/desktop_bus.rs) uses `pre_exec(pdeathsig_hook())` to call `prctl(PR_SET_PDEATHSIG, SIGTERM)` in the child between fork and exec. This makes the kernel send SIGTERM to the child when its parent dies, regardless of how the parent exits.

`prctl(PR_SET_PDEATHSIG, …)` is async-signal-safe and is invoked inside the closure passed to `CommandExt::pre_exec`. The `unsafe` block is confined to the closure body — the outer `pdeathsig_hook()` function is safe. SIGTERM (not SIGKILL) is used so children can clean up their own resources before exiting. Both modules are `#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]`, so there is no cross-platform shim needed.

## `sd_notify` socket address in `sd-notify`

[`crates/sd-notify/src/lib.rs`](crates/sd-notify/src/lib.rs) constructs a `sockaddr_un` by hand and calls `libc::socket` / `libc::sendto` to deliver `READY=1` to systemd. We do not link `libsystemd`. The whole module is `#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]` (other OSes get a no-op stub) since systemd is Linux-only and constants like `SOCK_CLOEXEC` and `MSG_NOSIGNAL` aren't portable to macOS. The unsafe surface is small and one-shot: build `sockaddr_un`, send one datagram, close the fd. The invariants: the path from `NOTIFY_SOCKET` is length-checked against `sun_path` before any byte is written so we never overflow the address buffer; only paths starting with `/` (filesystem) or `@` (Linux abstract namespace, leading byte rewritten to NUL) are accepted, anything else is silently dropped; the computed `addr_len` matches the documented kernel encoding for each form (sa_family + path bytes for abstract, sa_family + path bytes + trailing NUL for filesystem); the fd is opened with `SOCK_CLOEXEC` so it can't leak into PTY children; and every error path is best-effort — a missing `NOTIFY_SOCKET`, a truncated path, a failing `socket()`, or a failing `sendto()` all fall through to a normal return so the daemon never aborts on a notification failure.

## Runtime-loaded libpipewire in the audio pipeline

[`crates/server/src/audio_pw.rs`](crates/server/src/audio_pw.rs) dlopens `libpipewire-0.3.so.0` at runtime and drives a capture stream directly, in place of the former pw-cat subprocess + pipe read. Calling C through `dlsym`-resolved function pointers plus a hand-declared `#[repr(C)]` mirror of `pw_stream_events` and the SPA buffer structs means any ABI drift between the Rust declarations and the installed libpipewire will be memory unsafety — wrong struct sizes corrupt callback data, and mismatched `pw_stream_events` versions can read past the struct's end.

The invariants: we target `PW_VERSION_STREAM_EVENTS = 2` (present since PipeWire 0.3.39, so any distribution libpipewire is at least that new), the struct layouts mirror the 1.6.x public headers exactly, and the SPA POD is built with 8-byte-aligned bodies matching the documented binary format. The `pw_thread_loop` is stopped _before_ the user_data `Box` holding the mpsc sender is freed in `Drop`, so the RT callback can't race a freed pointer. The library handle is intentionally never `dlclose`'d — leaking it for process lifetime avoids any risk of dangling function pointers if a shutdown path accidentally held one. A `CaptureState::active` flag lets the callback short-circuit cheaply before touching the mpsc during Drop, but correctness does not depend on it — the thread-loop stop is what actually prevents further callbacks.

## Native camera decoders in `server`

[`crates/server/src/nvdec_decode.rs`](crates/server/src/nvdec_decode.rs) loads `libcuda.so.1` and `libnvcuvid.so.1` and mirrors the public NVDEC parser/decoder ABI. NVIDIA's parser calls the sequence, decode, and display callbacks synchronously. Callback user data points to the decoder state for exactly the lifetime of the parser; teardown destroys the parser before that state. Codec-specific `CUVIDPICPARAMS` remain opaque and are passed synchronously from the parser to `cuvidDecodePicture`. Sequence data, display rectangles, bit depth, chroma, and dimensions are validated before decoder allocation. A mapped output surface remains mapped while pitched device planes are copied with `cuMemcpyDtoH_v2`, and is unmapped on every success/error path. CUDA contexts are pushed only around operations that require them, popped before returning, and destroyed after the parser/decoder. `NvdecDecoder` is `Send` only because its uniquely owned state moves to one camera worker; it is never `Sync`.

[`crates/server/src/vaapi_decode.rs`](crates/server/src/vaapi_decode.rs) drives the existing runtime-loaded libva function table directly. Its H.264 and AV1 picture, IQ, slice, and tile parameter records mirror the public VA-API headers and are submitted with the exact buffer type and element count expected by the driver. The Rust stateless codec engine owns parser/DPB/reference logic and supplies references whose surfaces remain alive through submission. VA config/context/surface/buffer/image handles are destroyed in dependency order. A derived image stays mapped only while its validated NV12 or 444P pitches/offsets are read; unmap and image destruction occur on every path. Any new VA header revision or supported profile requires rechecking every mirrored record size, field order, enum value, and reserved field.

[`crates/server/src/video_decode_vulkan.rs`](crates/server/src/video_decode_vulkan.rs) owns a server-local Vulkan instance, device, video queue, session, DPB images, command pool, staging buffers, and fences. H.264 and AV1 StdVideo structures borrow parser/DPB data only through the synchronous `vkCmdDecodeVideoKHR` recording call; owned images and parameter storage outlive GPU completion. Image layouts/access masks transition from decode-DPB/output use to transfer readback and back before reference reuse. The fence completes before mapped staging bytes are read or any referenced resource is recycled. Drop waits for the device and destroys views/images/buffers/memory/session resources before the device and instance. Capability queries require the exact codec profile, 8-bit 4:2:0 or 4:4:4 format, extent, DPB use, and transfer-readback support; a 4:4:4 stream is never submitted to a 4:2:0 profile.

[`crates/server/src/software_decode.rs`](crates/server/src/software_decode.rs) uses pure-Rust codec implementations. The `rav1d` port exposes its Rust implementation through a C-shaped ownership API, so YAS still has small unsafe blocks around `Dav1dData`, `Dav1dPicture`, and `Dav1dContext` tokens. Input allocations are copied within their declared length and unreferenced exactly once. A returned picture owns its sequence header and planes until `dav1d_picture_unref`; dimensions, bit depth, layout, pointers, and signed strides are checked before plane reads. The context is confined to one worker, flushed only through exclusive access, and closed once in `Drop`. `oxideav-h264` is safe Rust; YAS adds an access-unit delimiter to each already-complete Annex-B packet so the current picture is finalized without flushing reference state.

Peer-controlled packets are capped at 4 MiB before any decoder. Negotiated dimensions/output sizes and keyframe sequence headers are checked first. Only bounded 8-bit output matching the exact dimensions and chroma is accepted. Decode runs in at most two workers with a two-frame lease queue and bounded completion channel. A backend failure cannot move a dependent frame into a fresh reference context: the chain is discarded and a keyframe requested. Golden software tests cover H.264 and AV1 in both 4:2:0 and 4:4:4 plus reset/recovery; opt-in device tests must cover each native backend, exact RGBA length, unsupported-profile fallback, and teardown.

## Audit checklist

- **fd leaks** — every `openpty`/`dup2`/`close` path must close all fds on failure, including in the child after a failed `execvp` (which falls through to `_exit`).
- **`waitpid` semantics** — both call sites must use `WNOHANG` and handle the case where the other already reaped the child.
- **macOS guards** — `proc_pidinfo` and `pthread_set_qos_class_self_np` must stay behind `#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]`.
- **WASM boundary** — `crates/browser/` targets `wasm32-unknown-unknown` and must never import `libc` or `std::os::unix`.
- **NVENC struct sizes** — every NVENC struct must be sized to match `nv-codec-headers` 12.1 exactly. The driver validates sizes via version tags — an oversized or undersized struct silently fails with error 15.
- **NVENC function list slots** — the function pointer index in `NvEncFunctionList` must match the SDK header's field order. A wrong slot calls a different function with incompatible arguments → undefined behavior.
- **VA-API byte offsets** — the SPS/PPS/slice parameter buffer offsets are hand-verified against `va_enc_h264.h`. If VA-API bumps struct versions, these must be re-verified.
- **dlopen lifetime** — the `DynLib` handle in each `*Fns` struct must not be dropped while function pointers are still callable. The `OnceLock<Option<*Fns>>` pattern ensures this for `'static`.
- **NVDEC callback/ABI lifetime** — every mirrored CUDA/NVCUVID struct and callback signature must match `nv-codec-headers`; parser user data, opaque picture parameters, mapped frames, context push/pop, and library handles must retain their documented lifetimes.
- **VA-API decode records** — every H.264/AV1 parameter struct, buffer type, enum, reserved field, and byte offset must match the supported libva headers. Derived images must be unmapped/destroyed on all paths.
- **Vulkan Video decode lifetime** — StdVideo pointers and DPB slot resources must outlive command recording and GPU completion. Session parameters, image layouts, access masks, staging reads, fences, and destruction order must remain codec/profile correct.
- **rav1d ownership** — each `Dav1dData`, `Dav1dPicture`, and `Dav1dContext` token is consumed or unreferenced exactly once; signed plane strides are used only while the picture owns the backing allocation.
- **Windows handle leaks** — every `CreatePipe`/`CreatePseudoConsole`/`CreateProcessW` path must close all handles on failure. `CloseHandle(pi.hThread)` must be called after `CreateProcessW` since the thread handle is unused.
- **Vulkan renderer resource ordering** — `VulkanRenderer::Drop` must destroy images, image views, descriptor sets, pipelines, and command buffers before destroying the device, and the device before the instance.
- **DMA-BUF import lifetime** — imported Vulkan memory from DMA-BUF fds must not outlive the client buffer; evicted persistent textures are deferred to `pending_destroy_textures` until the in-flight GPU submission completes.
- **Staging pointer lifetime** — the raw `vkMapMemory` pointer in `OutputImage::staging_ptr` is valid for one frame cycle (double-buffered output images). The encoder must consume the `PixelData::Bgra` before `retire_pending` is called again for the same output image.
- **`PR_SET_PDEATHSIG` on service children** — every long-lived child spawned by `AudioPipeline` or `DesktopBus` must use `pre_exec(pdeathsig_hook())`. Missing it means the child survives server restarts and leaks.

## Managed surface color

`crates/compositor/src/vulkan_render.rs` additionally owns RGBA16F render
passes and output rings for managed trees. Their staging allocation and read
length are eight bytes per pixel, against four for BGRA8; the ring cache key
includes that format. A submission retains the format and color class until
its fence completes. Only then are half floats read and expanded into owned
`Vec<f32>` pixels; resizing and transfer/gamut encoding use safe Rust. New
2:10:10:10 and 16-bit integer/float SHM and DMA-BUF formats use matching
Vulkan formats. SHM staging offsets, row lengths, and bounds use each format's
texel size. Linear DMA-BUF mmap fallback checks the complete range including
plane offset, brackets CPU access with DMA-BUF sync when supported, and
retains precision. Tiled buffers never enter that fallback. X formats force
alpha to one; 16-bit ARGB/XRGB views swap red and blue. Failed temporary
texture allocations release every resource acquired before failure.

`surface_color_encoder.rs` tests use rav1d's C-compatible API to independently
decode 8/10-bit output. Initialized context/data/picture objects own their
storage until explicit close/unref. Plane reads use the returned byte stride,
bit depth, and validated 64×64 extent and finish before picture unref. The
production managed encoder uses rav1e's safe API and writes from each padded
plane's visible origin.

Managed NVENC uploads use pitch-checked host buffers, NV12/P010 or planar
4:4:4, and register the matching format before encoding. SDK 12.1 AV1 depth
bitfields and H.264/AV1 color fields are verified against `nvEncodeAPI.h`;
10-bit support is queried before session creation. VA-API derives images and
checks every written plane against `VAImage.data_size`, pitches, and offsets
before mapping. Packed AYUV, Y410, and Y416 use little-endian component order
validated against mapped VA images; each map is paired with unmap. AV1 RT
formats, depth flags, and packed headers must
agree. CPU fallback conversion and packing run in safe Rust before these FFI
boundaries. GPU conversion uses the same equations in the shared shader.
NVENC OPAQUE_FD input validates color, chroma, bit depth, byte pitch, allocation
size, and chroma offset before CUDA import; a pending/failed fence drops the
frame. VA-API GPU exports validate the format and single-object plane layout,
retain all modifier plane offsets/pitches, and attach explicit synchronization.
Managed DMA-BUF pixels are consumed only by the encoder owning that surface;
CPU conversion never treats tiled/P010 memory as 8-bit linear NV12.

ICC transform construction is safe Rust. GPU LUT uploads use bounded 65³
RGBA16F tables packed into a 2D image. Weak cache entries are destroyed only
after the frame fence, and surface descriptions retain their LUT through
commit and rendering. Vulkan Video color conversion uses format-matched
8/10-bit plane views, device-local copies, ignored queue-family indices for
concurrent images, and fence ordering before encode. AV1's queried feature
structure stays alive through device creation. Setup DPB resources are bound
without claiming an already-active slot. Each coding scope declares the
persisted rate-control mode before issuing constant-QP encodes. GPU-only managed commits carry a
color class without exposing staging memory.

PipeWire format callbacks read only the declared, bounded POD and accept
plain IDs or fixated Choice(None, Id) values. Negotiated precision determines
checked frame size and stride. The process callback drops frames whose format
no longer matches the current negotiation before copying within buffer capacity.

Managed output pools retain their Vulkan allocations across subscriber changes.
NVENC pools are keyed by dimensions, color, and chroma; VA-API pools additionally
use the identities of the exporting encoder's owned DMA-BUF descriptors. A GPU
frame bundles these variants and each consumer selects only a matching profile
or its own surface. Pool replacement defers destruction until tracked GPU work
has retired. Conflicting Vulkan Video profiles use separate source images with
their own matching video profile lists.

VA-API 4:4:4 imports preserve the producer's explicit DRM modifier and every
plane offset/pitch. Planar outputs use separate Y/U/V storage views; packed
AYUV/XYUV, Y410, and Y416 use matching Vulkan formats and little-endian channel
layouts. GPU conversion and CPU uploads are compared against mapped VA images
in hardware tests. Managed exports allocate VA surfaces directly without VPP
contexts or intermediate RGB buffers; their sentinel IDs are never destroyed
as live VA resources. On import failure, the color image importer releases
partially allocated images, views, memory, and descriptors before falling back
to float readback.

Compute pipeline creation keeps shader modules alive through the Vulkan call
and destroys them on success or failure. A failed batch also destroys every
non-null pipeline handle returned by Vulkan. The caller owns successful
pipelines; renderer teardown destroys them before the device.
